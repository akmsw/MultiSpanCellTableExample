# MultiSpanCellTableExample
This repository contains the fully functional and fixed version of [this program](http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/Swing-Components/MultiSpanCellTableExample.htm) that allows the user to combine and split cells in a JTable without any library.
Since that program could be very useful, I uploaded a organized and fixed version for me to check when needed.
This version has:
- Multiple SonarLint & format fixes.
- [This pixel fix on the table columns](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38034623/12980444).
- [This StackOverflowError fix](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21977825/12980444).
### I ONLY SUMMARIZED THE ORIGINAL WORK WITH THE FIXES LISTED ABOVE - I DIDN'T DO THIS PROGRAM
